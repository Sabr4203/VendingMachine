1.)    For the next run I hope to be able to interact with mutiple vending mahcines at once and I need to put some intelegence behind the managerial system right now it just makes a JSON of what each machine will need to refill.  I think I can make the Main Window sort of like a managerial view but im not sure yet.  I ended up not using Kafka since I am doing everything in PYTHON right now and dont need a message handling system.  

2.) I managed to make the main window a magerial screen that monitors sales and stock of all the machine, it allows for a one button click reffil also has an option to simulate sales.  I changed the format of the json files to go along with the comments and also made it more dynamic

4.) Here is what it looks like right now
